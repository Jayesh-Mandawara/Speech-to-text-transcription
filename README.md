Problem number 21,
The problem statement is:-
Speech to text transcription for Indian languages. The problem entails transcription in the native script. The languages of interest are Hindi, Indian English, Urdu, Bengali and Punjabi.

We have created a website that is able to transcript these 5 languages from speech to text as per your convienence.
We have kept the website interface very simple so that everyone can use it freely and easily as per them.
It really helps us to save our time by reducing our efforts just by using our voice.
